  This is my first android project. It is mainly a team project and my team members consist of Md. Tanvir Alam and Kashob Kumar Roy. 
  The three of us worked hard equally to bring this project to life. 
  
  This is a fitness application. It can be used for workout tracking of different types. Besides it also includes google map feature 
  for finding nearby place. It includes a chatbot, which is an AIML bot. There is also a social media for sharing photo and updating
  status. The social media includes its very own messenger.
  
  Me along with my two friends made this project for our university second year lab project.
